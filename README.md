# Institute Management System

For this project I've used Tkinter and CustomTkinter for the frontend and MySQL for the backend for which I have used Xampp.

Download the "Tkinter" and "CustomTkinter" libraries from "Command Prompt" using "pip3" or "pip" depending upon your Python version.

FOR XAMPP: After starting it click on start button in front of "Apache" and "MySQL" to establish the connection to the database. Remember that Xampp should always be started while doing all the backend tasks to avoid any error. And after completion of your work click on stop button in front of "Apache" and "MySQL".
